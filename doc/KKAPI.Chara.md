## `CharacterApi`

Provides an easy way to add custom logic to all characters in the game and in studio.  It takes care of all the error-prone plumbing and lets you easily save and load data to the character cards.
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.Chara.CharacterApi

```

Static Properties

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `IEnumerable<ControllerRegistration>` | RegisteredHandlers | All currently registered kinds of `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController` controllers. | 


Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `ChaControl` | FileControlToChaControl(`ChaFileControl` fileControl) | Get ChaControl that is using the specified ChaFileControl. | 
| `IEnumerable<CharaCustomFunctionController>` | GetBehaviours(`ChaControl` character = null) | Get all extra behaviours for specified character. If null, returns extra behaviours for all characters. |

Static Events

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `EventHandler<CharaReloadEventArgs>` | CharacterReloaded | Fired after all CharaCustomFunctionController have updated. | 
| `EventHandler<CoordinateEventArgs>` | CoordinateLoaded | Fired after a coordinate card was loaded and all controllers were updated.  Not filed if the coordinate file was not loaded into a character (so not during list updates). | 
| `EventHandler<CoordinateEventArgs>` | CoordinateSaving | Fired just before a coordinate card is saved, but after all controllers wrote their data. | 


## `CharacterExtensions`

Extensions for use with ChaControl, ChaFile and similar
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.Chara.CharacterExtensions

```

Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `void` | BindToFunctionController(this `BaseEditableGuiEntry<TValue>` guiEntry, `GetValueForInterface<TController, TValue>` getValue, `SetValueToController<TController, TValue>` setValue) | Synchronize this maker control to the state of your custom `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController`.  When the control's value changes the change is sent to the controller, and when the character is reloaded  the change is automatically pulled from the controller into the control. | 
| `ChaControl` | GetChaControl(this `ChaFile` chaFile) | Get ChaControl that is using this ChaFile if any exist. | 
| `String` | GetFancyCharacterName(this `ChaFile` chaFile, `Boolean` describeIfEmpty = True) | Get cleaned up full name of this character, including its translation if available. | 
| `String` | GetSourceFilePath(this `ChaFile` chaFile) | Gets full path to the file where this ChaFile was loaded from. Usually this means the character card,  but can also point to a studio scene or a game save file if the character was contained inside them.  If the ChaFile was loaded from memory or copied, this will most likely return null. | 


## `CharaCustomFunctionController`

Base type for custom character extensions.  It provides many useful methods that abstract away the nasty hooks needed to figure out when  a character is changed or how to save and load your custom data to the character card.    This controller is a MonoBehaviour that is added to root gameObjects of ALL characters spawned into the game.  It's recommended to not use constructors, Awake or Start in controllers. Use `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnReload(KKAPI.GameMode,System.Boolean)` instead.
```csharp
public abstract class KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController
    : MonoBehaviour

```

Properties

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `ChaControl` | ChaControl | ChaControl of the character this controller is attached to. It's on the same gameObject as this controller. | 
| `ChaFileControl` | ChaFileControl | ChaFile of the character this controller is attached to. | 
| `ControllerRegistration` | ControllerRegistration | Definition of this kind of function controllers. | 
| `String` | ExtendedDataId | ID used for extended data by this controller. It's set when registering the controller  with `KKAPI.Chara.CharacterApi.RegisterExtraBehaviour``1(System.String)` | 
| `Boolean` | Started | True if this controller has been initialized | 


Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `void` | Awake() | Warning: When overriding make sure to call the base method at the end of your logic! | 
| `PluginData` | GetAccessoryExtData(`Int32` accessoryPartId, `Int32` coordinateId = -1) | Get extended data for a specific accessory.  Do not store this data because it might change without notice, for example when clothing is copied. Always call Get at the point where you need the data, not earlier.  If you change any of the data, remember to call the corresponding Set method or the change might not be saved.  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary.  If no extended data of this plugin was set yet, this method will return null.  In maker, you can update controls that use this data in the `KKAPI.Maker.MakerAPI.ReloadCustomInterface` event. | 
| `PluginData` | GetBodyExtData() | Get extended data for character's body (body sliders, tattoos).  Do not store this data because it might change without notice, for example when clothing is copied. Always call Get at the point where you need the data, not earlier.  If you change any of the data, remember to call the corresponding Set method or the change might not be saved.  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary.  If no extended data of this plugin was set yet, this method will return null.  In maker, you can update controls that use this data in the `KKAPI.Maker.MakerAPI.ReloadCustomInterface` event. | 
| `PluginData` | GetClothesExtData(`Int32` coordinateId = -1) | Get extended data for specific clothes.  Do not store this data because it might change without notice, for example when clothing is copied. Always call Get at the point where you need the data, not earlier.  If you change any of the data, remember to call the corresponding Set method or the change might not be saved.  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary.  If no extended data of this plugin was set yet, this method will return null.  In maker, you can update controls that use this data in the `KKAPI.Maker.MakerAPI.ReloadCustomInterface` event. | 
| `PluginData` | GetCoordinateExtendedData(`ChaFileCoordinate` coordinate) | Get extended data of the specified coordinate by using the ID you specified when registering this controller.  This should be used inside the `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnCoordinateBeingLoaded(ChaFileCoordinate,System.Boolean)` event.  Consider using one of the other "Get___ExtData" and "Set___ExtData" methods instead since they are more reliable and handle copying and transferring outfits and they conform to built in maker load toggles. | 
| `PluginData` | GetExtendedData() | Get extended data based on supplied ExtendedDataId. When in chara maker loads data from character that's being loaded.  This should be used inside the `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnReload(KKAPI.GameMode,System.Boolean)` event.  Consider using one of the other "Get___ExtData" and "Set___ExtData" methods instead since they are more reliable and handle copying and transferring outfits and they conform to built in maker load toggles. | 
| `PluginData` | GetExtendedData(`Boolean` getFromLoadedChara) | Get extended data based on supplied ExtendedDataId. When in chara maker loads data from character that's being loaded.  This should be used inside the `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnReload(KKAPI.GameMode,System.Boolean)` event.  Consider using one of the other "Get___ExtData" and "Set___ExtData" methods instead since they are more reliable and handle copying and transferring outfits and they conform to built in maker load toggles. | 
| `PluginData` | GetFaceExtData() | Get extended data for character's face (face sliders, eye settings).  Do not store this data because it might change without notice, for example when clothing is copied. Always call Get at the point where you need the data, not earlier.  If you change any of the data, remember to call the corresponding Set method or the change might not be saved.  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary.  If no extended data of this plugin was set yet, this method will return null.  In maker, you can update controls that use this data in the `KKAPI.Maker.MakerAPI.ReloadCustomInterface` event. | 
| `PluginData` | GetParameterExtData() | Get extended data for character's parameters (personality, preferences, traits).  Do not store this data because it might change without notice, for example when clothing is copied. Always call Get at the point where you need the data, not earlier.  If you change any of the data, remember to call the corresponding Set method or the change might not be saved.  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary.  If no extended data of this plugin was set yet, this method will return null.  In maker, you can update controls that use this data in the `KKAPI.Maker.MakerAPI.ReloadCustomInterface` event. | 
| `void` | OnCardBeingSaved(`GameMode` currentGameMode) | Fired when the character information is being saved.  It handles all types of saving (to character card, to a scene etc.)  Write any of your extended data in this method by using `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.SetExtendedData(ExtensibleSaveFormat.PluginData)`.  Avoid reusing old PluginData since we might no longer be pointed to the same character. | 
| `void` | OnCoordinateBeingLoaded(`ChaFileCoordinate` coordinate, `Boolean` maintainState) | Fired just after loading a coordinate card into the current coordinate slot.  Use `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.GetCoordinateExtendedData(ChaFileCoordinate)` to get save data of the loaded coordinate. | 
| `void` | OnCoordinateBeingLoaded(`ChaFileCoordinate` coordinate) | Fired just after loading a coordinate card into the current coordinate slot.  Use `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.GetCoordinateExtendedData(ChaFileCoordinate)` to get save data of the loaded coordinate. | 
| `void` | OnCoordinateBeingSaved(`ChaFileCoordinate` coordinate) | Fired just before current coordinate is saved to a coordinate card. Use `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.SetCoordinateExtendedData(ChaFileCoordinate,ExtensibleSaveFormat.PluginData)` to save data to it.  You might need to wait for the next frame with `UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine(System.Collections.IEnumerator)` before handling this. | 
| `void` | OnDestroy() | Warning: When overriding make sure to call the base method at the end of your logic! | 
| `void` | OnEnable() | Warning: When overriding make sure to call the base method at the end of your logic! | 
| `void` | OnReload(`GameMode` currentGameMode, `Boolean` maintainState) | OnReload is fired whenever the character's state needs to be updated.  This might be beacuse the character was just loaded into the game,  was replaced with a different character, etc.  Use this method instead of Awake and Start. It will always get called  before other methods, but after the character is in a usable state.  WARNING: Make sure to completely reset your state in this method!  Assume that all of your variables are no longer valid! | 
| `void` | OnReload(`GameMode` currentGameMode) | OnReload is fired whenever the character's state needs to be updated.  This might be beacuse the character was just loaded into the game,  was replaced with a different character, etc.  Use this method instead of Awake and Start. It will always get called  before other methods, but after the character is in a usable state.  WARNING: Make sure to completely reset your state in this method!  Assume that all of your variables are no longer valid! | 
| `void` | SetAccessoryExtData(`PluginData` data, `Int32` accessoryPartId, `Int32` coordinateId = -1) | Set extended data for a specific accessory.  Always call Set right after changing any of the data, or the change might not be saved if the data is changed for whatever reason (clothing change, reload, etc.)  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary. | 
| `void` | SetBodyExtData(`PluginData` data) | Set extended data for character's body (body sliders, tattoos).  Always call Set right after changing any of the data, or the change might not be saved if the data is changed for whatever reason (clothing change, reload, etc.)  This data is saved alongside game data, which means it is automatically copied and moved as necessary. | 
| `void` | SetClothesExtData(`PluginData` data, `Int32` coordinateId = -1) | Set extended data for specific clothes.

| `void` | SetCoordinateExtendedData(`ChaFileCoordinate` coordinate, `PluginData` data) | Set extended data to the specified coordinate by using the ID you specified when registering this controller.  This should be used inside the `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnCoordinateBeingSaved(ChaFileCoordinate)` event.  Consider using one of the other "Get___ExtData" and "Set___ExtData" methods instead since they are more reliable and handle copying and transferring outfits and they conform to built in maker load toggles. | 
| `void` | SetExtendedData(`PluginData` data) | Save your custom data to the character card under the ID you specified when registering this controller.  This should be used inside the `KKAPI.Chara.CharaCustomFunctionController.OnCardBeingSaved(KKAPI.GameMode)` event.
