## `ConfigurationManagerAttributes`

Class that specifies how a setting should be displayed inside the ConfigurationManager settings window.    Usage:  You can use this copy of the class instead of including it in your own plugin.  Make a new instance, assign any fields that you want to override, and pass it as a tag for your setting.    If a field is null (default), it will be ignored and won't change how the setting is displayed.  If a field is non-null (you assigned a value to it), it will override default behavior.
```csharp
public class KKAPI.Utilities.ConfigurationManagerAttributes

```

Fields

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | Browsable | Show this setting in the settings screen at all? If false, don't show. | 
| `String` | Category | Category the setting is under. Null to be directly under the plugin. | 
| `Action<ConfigEntryBase>` | CustomDrawer | Custom setting editor (OnGUI code that replaces the default editor provided by ConfigurationManager).  See below for a deeper explanation. Using a custom drawer will cause many of the other fields to do nothing. | 
| `Object` | DefaultValue | If set, a "Default" button will be shown next to the setting to allow resetting to default. | 
| `String` | Description | Optional description shown when hovering over the setting.  Not recommended, provide the description when creating the setting instead. | 
| `String` | DispName | Name of the setting. | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | HideDefaultButton | Force the "Reset" button to not be displayed, even if a valid DefaultValue is available. | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | HideSettingName | Force the setting name to not be displayed. Should only be used with a `KKAPI.Utilities.ConfigurationManagerAttributes.CustomDrawer` to get more space.  Can be used together with `KKAPI.Utilities.ConfigurationManagerAttributes.HideDefaultButton` to gain even more space. | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | IsAdvanced | If true, don't show the setting by default. User has to turn on showing advanced settings or search for it. | 
| `Func<Object, String>` | ObjToStr | Custom converter from setting type to string for the built-in editor textboxes. | 
| `Nullable<Int32>` | Order | Order of the setting on the settings list relative to other settings in a category.  0 by default, higher number is higher on the list. | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | ReadOnly | Only show the value, don't allow editing it. | 
| `Nullable<Boolean>` | ShowRangeAsPercent | Should the setting be shown as a percentage (only use with value range settings). | 
| `Func<String, Object>` | StrToObj | Custom converter from string to setting type for the built-in editor textboxes. | 


## `CoroutineUtils`

Utility methods for working with coroutines.
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.Utilities.CoroutineUtils

```

Static Fields

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `WaitForEndOfFrame` | WaitForEndOfFrame | Cached WaitForEndOfFrame. Use instead of creating a new instance every time to reduce garbage production. | 


Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `IEnumerator` | AppendCo(this `IEnumerator` baseCoroutine, `IEnumerator` appendCoroutine) | Create a coroutine that calls the appendCoroutine after baseCoroutine finishes | 
| `IEnumerator` | AppendCo(this `IEnumerator` baseCoroutine, `YieldInstruction` yieldInstruction) | Create a coroutine that calls the appendCoroutine after baseCoroutine finishes | 
| `IEnumerator` | AppendCo(this `IEnumerator` baseCoroutine, `Action[]` actions) | Create a coroutine that calls the appendCoroutine after baseCoroutine finishes | 
| `IEnumerator` | AttachToYield(this `IEnumerator` coroutine, `Action` onYieldAction) | Create a coroutine that is the same as the supplied coroutine, except every time it yields the onYieldAction is invoked.  (i.e. onYieldAction is invoked after every yield return in the original coroutine)  If the coroutine returns another coroutine, the action is not called for yields performed by the returned coroutine, only the topmost one. Use FlattenCo if that's an issue. | 
| `IEnumerator` | ComposeCoroutine(`IEnumerator[]` coroutine) | Create a coroutine that calls each of the supplied coroutines in order. | 
| `IEnumerator` | CreateCoroutine(`Action[]` actions) | Create a coroutine that calls each of the action delegates on consecutive frames.  One action is called per frame. First action is called right away. There is no frame skip after the last action. | 
| `IEnumerator` | CreateCoroutine(`YieldInstruction` yieldInstruction, `Action[]` actions) | Create a coroutine that calls each of the action delegates on consecutive frames.  One action is called per frame. First action is called right away. There is no frame skip after the last action. | 
| `IEnumerator` | FlattenCo(this `IEnumerator` coroutine) | Flatten the coroutine to yield all values directly. Any coroutines yield returned by this coroutine will have their values directly returned by this new coroutine (this is recursive).  For example if another coroutine is yielded by this coroutine, the yielded coroutine will not be returned and instead the values that it yields will be returned.  If a yielded coroutine yields yet another coroutine, that second coroutine's values will be returned directly from the flattened coroutine. | 
| `MethodInfo` | GetMoveNext(`MethodBase` targetMethod) | Find the compiler-generated MoveNext method that contains the Coroutine/UniTask code. It can be used to apply transpliers to Coroutines and UniTasks.  Note: When writing transpliers for coroutines you might want to turn off the "Decompiler\Decompile enumerators" setting in DnSpy so that you can see the real code.  UniTasks are considered "async/await" so you need to turn off the "Decompile async methods" setting instead. | 
| `MethodInfo` | PatchMoveNext(this `Harmony` harmonyInstance, `MethodBase` original, `HarmonyMethod` prefix = null, `HarmonyMethod` postfix = null, `HarmonyMethod` transpiler = null, `HarmonyMethod` finalizer = null, `HarmonyMethod` ilmanipulator = null) | Used to patch coroutines/IEnumerator methods and async UniTask methods.  This will method automatically find the compiler-generated MoveNext method that contains the coroutine code and apply patches on that. The method you patch must return an IEnumerator or an UniTask.  Warning: Postfix patches will not work as expected, they might be fired after every iteration. Prefix is practically the same as prefixing the entry method. It's best to only use transpliers with this method.  Note: When writing transpliers you might want to turn off the "Decompiler\Decompile enumerators/async" settings in DnSpy so that you can see the real code. | 
| `IEnumerator` | PreventFromCrashing(this `IEnumerator` coroutine) | Prevent a coroutine from getting stopped by exceptions. Exceptions are caught and logged.  Code after the exception is thrown doesn't run up until the next yield. The coroutine continues after the yield then. | 
| `void` | RunImmediately(this `IEnumerator` coroutine) | Fully executes the coroutine synchronously (immediately run all of its code till completion). | 
| `IEnumerator` | StopCoOnQuit(this `IEnumerator` enumerator) | Create a coroutine that is the same as the supplied coroutine, but will stop early if `KKAPI.KoikatuAPI.IsQuitting` is <c>true</c>.  If the coroutine returns another coroutine, the `KKAPI.KoikatuAPI.IsQuitting` check only runs on the topmost one. Use `KKAPI.Utilities.CoroutineUtils.FlattenCo(System.Collections.IEnumerator)` if that's an issue. | 
| `IEnumerator` | StripYields(this `IEnumerator` coroutine, `Boolean` onlyStripNulls = True, `Boolean` flatten = True) | Remove yields from the coroutine, making its code run immediately. |

API for adding Timeline support to other plugins. Support is done by registering interpolable models that appear in the interpolables list in Timeline.
```csharp

Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `void` | AddCharaFunctionInterpolable(`String` owner, `String` id, `String` name, `InterpolableCharaDelegate<TValue, TController>` interpolateBefore, `InterpolableCharaDelegate<TValue, TController>` interpolateAfter, `Func<OCIChar, TController, TValue>` getValue, `Func<TController, XmlNode, TValue>` readValueFromXml = null, `Action<TController, XmlTextWriter, TValue>` writeValueToXml = null, `Func<OCIChar, TController, TValue, TValue, Boolean>` checkIntegrity = null, `Boolean` useOciInHash = True, `Func<String, OCIChar, TController, String>` getFinalName = null, `Func<OCIChar, TController, Boolean>` shouldShow = null) | Adds an interpolableModel that targets CharaCustomFunctionControllers on characters to the available interpolables list. This interpolable can then be instantiated by the user by adding a keyframe. | 
| `void` | AddInterpolableModelDynamic(`String` owner, `String` id, `String` name, `InterpolableDelegate<TValue, TParameter>` interpolateBefore, `InterpolableDelegate<TValue, TParameter>` interpolateAfter, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, Boolean>` isCompatibleWithTarget, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, TParameter, TValue>` getValue, `Func<TParameter, XmlNode, TValue>` readValueFromXml = null, `Action<TParameter, XmlTextWriter, TValue>` writeValueToXml = null, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, TParameter>` getParameter = null, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, XmlNode, TParameter>` readParameterFromXml = null, `Action<ObjectCtrlInfo, XmlTextWriter, TParameter>` writeParameterToXml = null, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, TParameter, TValue, TValue, Boolean>` checkIntegrity = null, `Boolean` useOciInHash = True, `Func<String, ObjectCtrlInfo, TParameter, String>` getFinalName = null, `Func<ObjectCtrlInfo, TParameter, Boolean>` shouldShow = null) | Adds an interpolableModel with a dynamic parameter to the available interpolables list. This interpolable can then be instantiated by the user by adding a keyframe.  The dynamic parameter means that every time user creates this interpolable, you can provide a different parameter - this allows having multiple instances of this interpolable for a single studio object. The instances are differentiated by the parameter, which must be unique and have a unique hash code (if the parameters have identical hashes they are treated as the same thing).  Examples where this is useful: editing individual character bone positions/scales, changing color of individual accessories.  If you want to make a global interpolable you can use AddInterpolableModelStatic instead.  Try to keep the callbacks as light and self-contained as possible since they can be called on every frame during playback or UI usage (except the xml callbacks). If you need to find some object to later use in the callbacks, consider using it as the parameter (that way it will only be computed once and you can use it later for free, just make sure the parameter is always the same since if you have different parameters will create separate instances). |

Examples where this is useful: editing individual character bone positions/scales, changing color of individual accessories.  If you want to make a global interpolable you can use AddInterpolableModelStatic instead.  Try to keep the callbacks as light and self-contained as possible since they can be called on every frame during playback or UI usage (except the xml callbacks). If you need to find some object to later use in the callbacks, consider using it as the parameter (that way it will only be computed once and you can use it later for free, just make sure the parameter is always the same since if you have different parameters will create separate instances). |

| `Single` | GetDuration() | Gets the total duration in seconds. | 
| `Boolean` | GetIsPlaying() | Check if timeline is currently playing. | 
| `Single` | GetPlaybackTime() | Gets current playback location in seconds. | 
| `Boolean` | IsTimelineAvailable() | Check if Timeline is loaded and available to be used. If false, other methods in this class will throw.  This must be called after all plugins finish loadeding (in Start/Main instead of constructors/Awake).  It always returns false outside of studio. | 
| `void` | Play() | Play/Pause timeline playback (toggles between the two). | 
| `void` | RefreshInterpolablesList() | Refreshes the list of displayed interpolables. This function is quite heavy as it must go through each InterpolableModel and check if it's compatible with the current target.  It is called automatically by Timeline when selecting another Workspace object or GuideObject.  This triggers visibility checks of all interpolables and can be used to force update all instances of your interpolables if something important changes and Timeline doesn't notice it. | 


## `TranslationHelper`

Class that abstracts away AutoTranslator. It lets you translate text to current language.
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.Utilities.TranslationHelper

```

Static Properties

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Boolean` | AutoTranslatorInstalled | True if a reasonably recent version of AutoTranslator is installed.  It might return false for some very old versions that don't have the necessary APIs to make this class work. | 


Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `void` | TranslateAsync(`String` untranslatedText, `Action<String>` onCompleted) | Queries AutoTranslator to provide a translated text for the untranslated text.  If the translation cannot be found in the cache, it will make a request to the translator selected by the user.  If AutoTranslator is not installed, this will do nothing. | 
| `Boolean` | TryTranslate(`String` untranslatedText, `String&` translatedText) | Queries the plugin to provide a translated text for the untranslated text.  If the translation cannot be found in the cache, the method returns false  and returns null as the untranslated text. | 


## `WindowsStringComparer`

String comparer that is equivalent to the one used by Windows Explorer to sort files (e.g. 2 will go before 10, unlike normal compare).
```csharp
public class KKAPI.Utilities.WindowsStringComparer
    : IComparer<String>

```

Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Int32` | Compare(`String` x, `String` y) | Compare two strings with rules used by Windows Explorer to logically sort files. | 


Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Int32` | LogicalCompare(`String` x, `String` y) | Compare two strings with rules used by Windows Explorer to logically sort files. |
