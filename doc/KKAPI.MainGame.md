## `EventUtils`

Utilities for creating and playing custom ADV scenes (talking scenes with the text box at the bottom).  Check CommandList.CommandGet in dnSpy to see source for different ADV commands that you can use.  You can use the ADV_Editor plugin to help with creating custom events: https://github.com/ManlyMarco/ADV_Editor  <code>  var list = EventUtils.CreateNewEvent();  list.Add(Program.Transfer.Text(EventUtils.HeroineName, "Hi, what's your hobby?"));  list.Add(Program.Transfer.Text(EventUtils.PlayerName, "I make plugins for KK!"));  list.Add(Program.Transfer.Text(EventUtils.HeroineName, "That got me wet, take me now!"));  list.Add(Program.Transfer.Text(EventUtils.PlayerName, "No time, writing code."));  list.Add(Program.Transfer.Close());  return EventUtils.StartTextSceneEvent(talkScene, list, decreaseTalkTime: true);  </code>
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.MainGame.EventUtils

```

Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `List<Transfer>` | CreateNewEvent(`Boolean` waitForSceneFade = False, `Boolean` setPlayerParam = True) | Helper for creating a new event command list. Sets up player variables automatically. | 
| `Player` | GetPlayerData() | Get current save data of the player | 
| `IEnumerator` | StartAdvEvent(`List<Transfer>` list, `Boolean` dialogOnly, `Vector3` position, `Quaternion` rotation, `OpenDataProc` extraData = null, `CameraData` camera = null, `List<Heroine>` heroines = null) | Start a new ADV event. Can be used in roaming mode and some other cases. Do not use in TalkScenes, use `KKAPI.MainGame.EventUtils.StartTextSceneEvent(TalkScene,System.Collections.Generic.List{ADV.Program.Transfer},System.Boolean,System.Boolean)` instead.  Can get variables set in the commands through actScene.AdvScene.Scenario.Vars  You can use Program.SetParam(player, list) to add all parameters related to player/heroine. Alternatively use the CharaChange command. | 
| `IEnumerator` | StartTextSceneEvent(`TalkScene` talkScene, `List<Transfer>` list, `Boolean` endTalkScene = False, `Boolean` decreaseTalkTime = False) | Start a new ADV event inside of a TalkScene (same as stock game events when talking).  The target heroine is automatically added to the heroine list, and its vars are set at the very start. | 


## `GameAPI`

Provides API for interfacing with the main game. It is useful mostly in the actual game, but some  functions will work outside of it (for example in FreeH).
```csharp
public static class KKAPI.MainGame.GameAPI

```

Static Properties

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Boolean` | InsideHScene | True if any sort of H scene is currently loaded. | 


Static Methods

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `IDisposable` | AddActionIcon(`Int32` mapNo, `Vector3` position, `Sprite` iconOn, `Sprite` iconOff, `Action` onOpen, `Action<TriggerEnterExitEvent>` onCreated = null, `Boolean` delayed = True, `Boolean` immediate = False) | Register a new action icon in roaming mode (like the icons for training/studying, club report screen, peeping).  Dispose the return value to remove the icon.  Icon templates can be found here https://github.com/IllusionMods/IllusionModdingAPI/tree/master/src/KKAPI/MainGame/ActionIcons | 
| `IDisposable` | AddTouchIcon(`Sprite` icon, `Action<Button>` onCreated, `Int32` row = 1, `Int32` order = 0) | Register a new touch icon in talk scenes in roaming mode (like the touch and look buttons on top right when talking to a character).  Dispose the return value to remove the icon.  Icon templates can be found here https://github.com/IllusionMods/IllusionModdingAPI/tree/master/src/KKAPI/MainGame/TouchIcons  By default this functions as a simple button. If you want to turn this into a toggle you have to manually switch button.image.sprite as needed. | 
| `IEnumerable<GameCustomFunctionController>` | GetBehaviours() | Get all registered behaviours for the game. | 
| `GameCustomFunctionController` | GetRegisteredBehaviour(`String` extendedDataId) | Get the first controller that was registered with the specified extendedDataId. | 
| `GameCustomFunctionController` | GetRegisteredBehaviour(`Type` controllerType) | Get the first controller that was registered with the specified extendedDataId. | 
| `GameCustomFunctionController` | GetRegisteredBehaviour(`Type` controllerType, `String` extendedDataId) | Get the first controller that was registered with the specified extendedDataId. | 
| `void` | RegisterExtraBehaviour(`String` extendedDataId) | Register new functionality that will be added to main game. Offers easy API for custom main game logic.  All you have to do is create a type that inherits from `KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController`&gt;  (don't make instances, the API will make them for you). Warning: The custom controller is immediately  created when it's registered, but its OnGameLoad method is not called until a game actually loads.  This might mean that if the registration happens too late you will potentially miss some load events. | 


Static Events

| Type | Name | Summary | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `EventHandler` | EndH | Fired after an H scene is ended, but before it is unloaded. Can be both in the main game and in free h.  Runs immediately after all `KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController` objects trigger their events. | 
| `EventHandler<GameSaveLoadEventArgs>` | GameLoad | Fired right after a game save is succesfully loaded.  Runs immediately after all `KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController` objects trigger their events. | 
| `EventHandler<GameSaveLoadEventArgs>` | GameSave | Fired right before the game state is saved to file.  Runs immediately after all `KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController` objects trigger their events. | 
| `EventHandler` | StartH | Fired after an H scene is loaded. Can be both in the main game and in free h.  Runs immediately after all `KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController` objects trigger their events. | 


## `GameCustomFunctionController`

Base type for custom game extensions.  It provides many useful methods that abstract away the nasty hooks needed to figure out when the state of the game  changes.    This controller is a MonoBehaviour that is created upon registration in `KKAPI.MainGame.GameAPI.RegisterExtraBehaviour``1(System.String)`.  The controller is created only once. If it's created too late it might miss some events.  It's recommended to register controllers in your Start method.
```csharp
public abstract class KKAPI.MainGame.GameCustomFunctionController
    : MonoBehaviour

```
